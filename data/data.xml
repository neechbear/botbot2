After years of surveillance, he ensnares Mary in an elaborate sting to ensure she can be charged with plotting to assassinate the Queen. The trial sparks an international crisis. Elizabeth's advisors urge her to sign the death warrant, but she is all too aware of the terrible consequences. If Mary is executed, the Spanish are ready to exact bloody revenge by unleashing a massive Armada against England. [S]</desc>

    <title lang="en">Johnny Cash: the Last Great American...</title>
    <desc lang="en">Johnny Cash sang with Elvis Presley in the 50s, Bob Dylan in the 60s and Bono in the 90s. He died in September 2003 shortly after completing the retrospective 'Unearthed', a 5 CD-set of the acoustic performances with which he resurrected his career in the last decade of his life, and after losing his wife and love of his life, June Carter Cash, in June 2003. This first major retrospective of Cash's life, times and music features contributions from his daughter Rosanne Cash and son John Carter Cash, his longtime manager Lou Robin and fellow musicians including Little Richard, Cowboy Jack Clement, Kris Kristofferson, Merle Haggard and Elvis Costello .Cash was the son of a poor sharecropper from Kingsland, Arkansas, who sang folk, spiritual and country songs to himself while picking cotton in the fields. In the 50s he signed to Sam Phillips' Sun Records, scored his first hits and was part of the 'Million Dollar Quartet' with Elvis, Jerry Lee Lewis and Carl Perkins. In the 60s he created his famous 'Man in Black' persona, and became a huge country star with hits like 'Folsom Prison Blues', 'Ring of Fire', 'I Walk the Line' and 'A Boy Named Sue' while torn between drug dependency, hellraising and a powerful spirituality. Cash had long since established himself as a man of the people with his prison concerts beginning with an incendiary performance in San Quentin in 1958. He ended the decade by finally marrying June Carter, daughter of the legendary Carter Family who helped invent American country music, launching his own national TV series from Nashville, duetting with Bob Dylan, befriending the Native American movement and opposing the war in Vietnam while playing concerts for the soldiers in the field.

    <title lang="en">The Virgin Queen</title>
    <desc lang="en">Now in her forties, Elizabeth makes one final fling for marriage - this time to the French Duke of Anjou, who is less than half her age. Meanwhile, Mary Queen of Scots - currently held captive in England - appears to be building allies across Catholic Europe. But Elizabeth's spymaster Francis Walsingham needs proof. After years of surveillance, he ensnares Mary in an elaborate sting to ensure she can be charged with plotting to assassinate the Queen. The trial sparks an international crisis. Elizabeth's advisors urge her to sign the death warrant, but she is all too aware of the terrible consequences. If Mary is executed, the Spanish are ready to exact bloody revenge by unleashing a massive Armada against England. [S]</desc>

    <title lang="en">Johnny Cash: the Last Great American...</title>
    <desc lang="en">Johnny Cash sang with Elvis Presley in the 50s, Bob Dylan in the 60s and Bono in the 90s. He died in September 2003 shortly after completing the retrospective 'Unearthed', a 5 CD-set of the acoustic performances with which he resurrected his career in the last decade of his life, and after losing his wife and love of his life, June Carter Cash, in June 2003. This first major retrospective of Cash's life, times and music features contributions from his daughter Rosanne Cash and son John Carter Cash, his longtime manager Lou Robin and fellow musicians including Little Richard, Cowboy Jack Clement, Kris Kristofferson, Merle Haggard and Elvis Costello .Cash was the son of a poor sharecropper from Kingsland, Arkansas, who sang folk, spiritual and country songs to himself while picking cotton in the fields. In the 50s he signed to Sam Phillips' Sun Records, scored his first hits and was part of the 'Million Dollar Quartet' with Elvis, Jerry Lee Lewis and Carl Perkins. In the 60s he created his famous 'Man in Black' persona, and became a huge country star with hits like 'Folsom Prison Blues', 'Ring of Fire', 'I Walk the Line' and 'A Boy Named Sue' while torn between drug dependency, hellraising and a powerful spirituality. Cash had long since established himself as a man of the people with his prison concerts beginning with an incendiary performance in San Quentin in 1958. He ended the decade by finally marrying June Carter, daughter of the legendary Carter Family who helped invent American country music, launching his own national TV series from Nashville, duetting with Bob Dylan, befriending the Native American movement and opposing the war in Vietnam while playing concerts for the soldiers in the field.

Equipped with amphibious buggies they head for Brazil's Pantanal, the world's biggest wetland, where jaguars feast on Caiman, Peccaries, Capybara and occasionally cattle. Deep in the wilderness, as the cameras begin to reveal remarkable new behaviour, the film makers start to wonder just who is stalking whom.</desc>

    <desc lang="en">It is the most famous equation of them all and it made Albert Einstein the most celebrated scientist in history. It explains things of sheer wonder - like why the sun shines and how, after Big Bang, the universe was created. But it also underpins the most destructive force ever unleashed on the planet - the nuclear bomb. This documentary with dramatised elements tells the story of how his most famous discovery, E=MC&amp;#178;, went from being a mere set of symbols in a notebook to a weapon of mass destruction. It was something that so haunted Einstein, a lifelong pacifist, that he would describe his involvement in the bomb as his 'biggest blunder'.</desc>

    <desc lang="en">It is the most famous equation of them all and it made Albert Einstein the most celebrated scientist in history. It explains things of sheer wonder - like why the sun shines and how, after Big Bang, the universe was created. But it also underpins the most destructive force ever unleashed on the planet - the nuclear bomb. This documentary with dramatised elements tells the story of how his most famous discovery, E=MC&amp;#178;, went from being a mere set of symbols in a notebook to a weapon of mass destruction. It was something that so haunted Einstein, a lifelong pacifist, that he would describe his involvement in the bomb as his 'biggest blunder'.</desc>
